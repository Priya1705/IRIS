# IRIS

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).


code_iris.py --- loads this dataset from sklearn.datasets and builds a model using KNN and does prediction for new values of the features.

iris.py      ---loads this dataset from a iris.data file and builds a model using KNN and does prediction for new values of the features.
